    "## Mortgage Calculation Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is dedicated to the functions that are crucial for managing and understanding mortgage finances. Here, we have developed several functions to assist homeowners and potential buyers by calculating monthly mortgage payments, generating detailed amortization schedules, and evaluating the financial benefits of making extra payments. These tools are designed to accommodate various scenarios, including adjustments for extra monthly payments or lump sum contributions, thus offering a clear picture of the financial implications over the life of the mortgage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`calc_monthly_payment`:** This function calculates the monthly payment required for a mortgage based on the loan's principal amount, the term of the loan, and the annual interest rate. Understanding this figure is essential for budgeting and financial planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`amortization_schedule`:** This function generates a comprehensive amortization schedule that outlines how each payment affects the loan balance over time. It includes options to account for additional payments, which can significantly reduce the loan's interest cost and shorten its term.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`calculate_remaining_years`:** This function determines how many years are left on a mortgage after accounting for extra payments. It's useful for understanding the impact of making additional payments above the regular monthly amount, including lump sum payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`calculate_total_interest_saved`:** This function calculates the total interest saved over the life of the mortgage when making extra monthly payments and/or lump sum payments. It helps quantify the financial benefits of paying more than the minimum required each month or making significant one-time payments towards the principal.\n",
    "- **`calculate_remaining_mortgage`**: Calculates the remaining mortgage balance after accounting for a lump sum payment at the start of the term. Ensures the balance never goes negative, providing a realistic loan balance scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions provide essential insights into the dynamics of mortgage amortization, helping you make informed decisions about your home financing or investment strategy. They are invaluable for anyone looking to minimize their interest payments and reduce the term of their mortgage."

    "# Return on Investment (ROI) Analysis\n",
    "In this section, we analyze the return on investment for extra payments made towards the mortgage. We calculate various forms of ROI to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the investment in terms of interest savings over the lifetime of the mortgage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of ROI Calculated\n",
    "- ### Simple ROI\n",
    "  - **Definition:** Simple ROI measures the efficiency of an investment without adjusting for time. It provides a quick snapshot of the overall effectiveness of the additional payments compared to the initial investment.\n",
    "  - **Calculation:**\n",
    "Simple ROI = ((Total Interest Saved - Total Extra Payments) / Total Extra Payments) * 100\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### Annualized ROI\n",
    "  - **Definition:** This calculation annualizes the return, allowing you to compare the efficiency of your mortgage investments against other investments that also report annual returns. It is useful for evaluating investment performance adjusted for time.\n",
    "  - **Calculation:**\n",
    "Annualized ROI = ((Total Interest Saved - Total Extra Payments) / Total Extra Payments / Number of Years) * 100\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)\n",
    "  - **Definition:** Provides a compound annual growth rate, which is particularly useful for understanding the performance of an investment over time considering the effect of compound interest. This is crucial if we consider the interest savings as a continuous reinvestment.\n",
    "  - **Calculation:**\n",
    "CAGR = (((Final Value / Initial Investment) ** (1 / Number of Years)) - 1) * 100. Where *Final Value* includes the total interest saved plus the initial lump sum, and *Initial Investment* is the lump sum payment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### Linear Annual ROI\n",
    "  - **Definition:** Similar to Annualized ROI but focuses on distributing the return linearly over the investment years. This approach assumes a constant return each year, which simplifies the analysis but may not capture the actual variability year-over-year.\n",
    "  - **Calculation:**\n",
    "Linear Annual ROI = ((Total Interest Saved - Total Extra Payments) / (Total Extra Payments * Number of Years)) * 100\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application\n",
    "These ROI metrics will help us understand not only the immediate benefits but also the long-term advantages of making extra payments on the mortgage. By quantifying the savings and comparing them to other potential investments, homeowners can make informed decisions about where to allocate their funds for maximum financial benefit."

    "# Amortization Schedule Analysis\n",
    "In this section, we present the amortization schedules for the mortgages under consideration. The schedules take into account the principal amounts, interest rates, terms, and any extra payments or lump sums. These schedules help in understanding how each payment affects the loan balance over time, and they provide a clear view of the amortization process under the French amortization system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of Amortization Schedule\n",
    "The amortization schedule details each payment's impact on the loan balance, showing the split between principal and interest, as well as the remaining balance after each payment. By incorporating extra payments and lump sum contributions, we can observe the accelerated reduction in principal, which results in significant savings on interest over the loan's lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components of the Amortization Schedule:\n",
    "- **Total Payment**: The total amount paid monthly, including both principal and interest.\n",
    "- **Interest**: The interest component of the monthly payment.\n",
    "- **Principal**: The portion of the monthly payment that goes towards reducing the loan balance.\n",
    "- **Remaining Balance**: The outstanding balance of the loan after each payment.\n",
    "- **Remaining Years**: The number of years left until the loan is fully paid off, recalculated each month.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method Used:\n",
    "- **French Amortization Method**: This method ensures that the total payment amount is fixed (assuming no changes to the interest rate or loan terms), with the interest component decreasing and the principal component increasing over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Amortization Tables\n",
    "Below are the generated amortization tables for Mortgage 1 and Mortgage 2, including details about the monthly payments, interest and principal parts, and the decreasing loan balances over the years.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mortgage 1 Amortization Table\n",
    "This table starts from the current year and details each payment's effect under the terms agreed upon for Mortgage 1, including any extra payments and the impact of the initial lump sum."
