# Mortgage Amortization Calculator :house_with_garden:

Welcome to the Mortgage Amortization Calculator! This tool is designed to assist you in understanding and comparing different mortgage plans. It accounts for effects like lump sum payments and additional monthly payments on your total interest and the term of the mortgage.

## Installation :wrench:

To get started with this calculator, you need to install some Python libraries. Hereâ€™s how you can set it up on your system:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Mortgage-Amortization-Tool.git
cd Mortgage-Amortization-Tool

# Install required Python libraries
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas plotly ipywidgets numpy_financial
```

## Usage :computer:

Run the Jupyter Notebook in your local environment:

```bash
jupyter notebook MortgageCalculatorPro.ipynb
```

Follow the prompts in the notebook to enter your mortgage details:

- Enter the principal amount.
- Specify the term of the loan in years.
- Input the annual interest rate.

You can also specify:

- Any lump sum payments.
- Additional monthly payments.

The calculator will then display detailed amortization schedules and graphs comparing your inputted mortgage plans.

## Technical Details :gear:

This calculator uses the following Python libraries to perform calculations and generate visualizations:

- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib and Plotly**: For generating interactive visualizations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and presentation.
- **numpy_financial**: For financial calculations like monthly payments.

The core functionality is encapsulated in functions that calculate monthly payments, generate amortization schedules, and assess the impact of extra payments on interest savings.

## Financial Insights :dollar:

- **Understand Your Mortgage**: Visualize how your payment affects the principal and interest over time.
- **Compare Scenarios**: Side-by-side comparison of different payment strategies and their long-term impact.
- **Save on Interest**: Learn how additional payments can decrease the total amount of interest paid and shorten your loan term.
